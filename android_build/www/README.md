## Information

This project is a **YouTube Music Player Web Application** that allows users to stream and control YouTube videos as an interactive music player. It features a custom playlist, enabling users to select and play songs seamlessly. The app includes auto-play, repeat mode, and volume control, along with a progress bar for tracking playback. Additionally, a dark mode toggle enhances user experience. The interface is styled using Bootstrap and custom CSS animations, while JavaScript manages the YouTube IFrame API for video playback. The app also dynamically updates the background image based on the selected song, creating a visually engaging experience.

The player in this project is created using the **YouTube IFrame API**, which allows embedding and controlling YouTube videos through JavaScript.

## Installable App / PWA

This project includes Progressive Web App support:

- `manifest.webmanifest` provides the app name, theme color, launch URL, and install icons.
- `sw.js` caches the local app shell so the installed app can open reliably.
- `pwa.js` registers the service worker in supported browsers.

To install it, serve the project over `localhost` for development or deploy it over HTTPS, then open it in a browser that supports PWAs. In Chrome or Edge, use the install icon in the address bar or the browser menu. On mobile, use the browser's "Add to Home Screen" option.

YouTube playback, search, lyrics, and translation features still require network access because they depend on external services.

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### YouTube Search Functionality (GitHub Secrets Method - Recommended)

For secure API key management, this project uses GitHub Secrets:

1. **Get a YouTube Data API Key**:
   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a new project or select an existing one
   - Enable the **YouTube Data API v3**
   - Create credentials (API key)
   - Restrict the API key to YouTube Data API v3 for security

2. **Add Your API Key to GitHub Secrets**:
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Click on **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
   - Click **New repository secret**
   - Name: `YOUTUBE_API_KEY`
   - Value: Your actual YouTube Data API key
   - Click **Add secret**

3. **Deploy**:
   - The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically inject your API key during deployment
   - Push any changes to the `main` branch to trigger a new deployment
   - Your API key remains secure and is never exposed in your code

### Alternative: Local Development Setup

For local development, you can still manually add the API key:

1. **Clone the repository locally**
2. **Find**: `const YOUTUBE_API_KEY = "YOUR_YOUTUBE_API_KEY";` **in script.js**
3. **Replace** `YOUR_YOUTUBE_API_KEY` with your actual API key
4. **Important**: Never commit this change to prevent exposing your API key

### API Usage Information

- **Daily Quotas**: The YouTube Data API has daily quotas
- **Search Requests**: Each search consumes quota units
- **Free Tier**: Should be sufficient for personal use
- **Rate Limiting**: The app includes error handling for API limits

### Without API Key

If you don't want to set up the YouTube API, you can still:
- Use the existing default playlist
- Manually add songs by editing the `playlist` array in `script.js`
- Search and filter your existing playlist
- Import and Export Playlist & Data
- Add a song using a YouTube video link: https://jacob7179.github.io/YouTube-Music-Player-Web/?add_song=`YOUTUBE_VIDEO_LINK`

## 🎵 How to Use

1. **Playing Songs**: Click on any song in your playlist to play it
2. **Search YouTube**: Use the search bar to find new songs on YouTube
3. **Add Songs**: Click the "Add" button next to search results to add them to your playlist
4. **Persistent Playlist**: Your playlist is saved in browser storage and persists across sessions
5. **Remove Songs**: Click the trash icon next to songs in your playlist to remove them
6. **Search Playlist**: Use the playlist search bar to filter your existing songs
7. **Controls**: Use play/pause, next/previous, volume, and repeat controls

9. **Lyrics**: Toggle to view the song’s lyrics
10. **Language**: Languages available: English, 简体中文, 繁體中文, 日本語 & 한국어
11. **Drag and Drop**: Drag songs to reorder your playlist
12. **Secure API Key Management**: Uses GitHub Secrets for secure API key storage
13. **Lyrics Translate**: Enable "Lyrics Translation" button on "Settings" to translate supported language (English, 简体中文, 繁體中文, 日本語 & 한국어)
14. **Optimized Search**: Searched result will store in browser storage (No need to waste Quota for same results)
15. **Import Playlist & Data**: Import playlist and data (Dark mode, Album Art spin settings & Lyrics settings) from JSON or TXT file
16. **Export Playlist & Data**: Export playlist and data (Dark mode, Album Art spin settings & Lyrics settings) to TXT file
17. **Album Art Display**: Select Album Art Display option to switch Spin, None or Video mode.
18. **Delete Search Cache**: Delete search cache from browser storage
19. **Set the Current Song’s Lyrics Time Offset**: In the browser console, run `setCurrentSongLyricsTimeOffset(0.75);` to adjust the current song’s lyric timing by 0.75 seconds.

## 🔧 GitHub Actions Workflow

This project uses GitHub Actions to:
- **Securely inject** the YouTube API key from GitHub Secrets
- **Automatically deploy** to GitHub Pages on every push to main
- **Keep your API key safe** by never exposing it in the repository

The workflow file is located at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.
